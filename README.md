# Getting Started
Getting started developing with this template is pretty simple using docker and docker-compose.

## Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/VKU-NewEnergy/vietnamese-laws-ai-system-ai.git
```

## cd into project root
```
cd vietnamese-laws-ai-system-ai
```

## Launch the project
### Run locally
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
### Using docker
```
docker-compose up

Afterwards, FastAPI automatically generates documentation based on the specification of the endpoints you have written. You can find the docs at http://localhost:9000/docs.
